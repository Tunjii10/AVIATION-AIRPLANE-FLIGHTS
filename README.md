# AVIATION-AIRPLANE-FLIGHTS
This is the premiere project by the ml-pack group of the Hamoye Data science Internship - August 2021

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The aviation industry provides a total of 87.7 million jobs worldwide. It directly generates employment opportunities within the airlines, air navigation services providers, and airport operators. It additionally creates jobs via the supply chain in the transportation of goods and services. 
The introduction of data scientists and machine learning engineers play a significant role to ensure the smooth running of the operation in flights, maintenance of body parts, customer service interaction, and even the prevention of aircraft crashes.
For this project, we'll be looking to give account of accident occurrence, derive insight from patterns and trends, as seen in the dataset, to help make informed decisions that will help curtail such happening.

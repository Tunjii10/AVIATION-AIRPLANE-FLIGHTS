# AVIATION-AIRPLANE-FLIGHTS
This is the premiere project by the ml-pack group of the Hamoye Data science Internship - August 2021

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The aviation industry provides a total of 87.7 million jobs worldwide. It directly generates employmentopportunities within the airlines, air navigation services providers, and airport operators. It additionallycreates jobs via the supply chain in the transportation of goods and services. The introduction of datascientists and machine learning engineers play a significant role to ensure the smooth running of theoperation in flights, maintenance of body parts, customer service interaction, and even the prevention ofaircraft crashes.
For this project, we'll be looking to give account of accident occurrence, derive insight from patterns andtrends, as seen in the dataset, to help make informed decisions that will help curtail such happening.
